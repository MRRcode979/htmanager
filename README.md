# htmanager

htmanager is a high end website project manager written in Rust and is 100% open source forever.

**I will be accepting contributions.**

## What can htmanager do?

htmanager can do the following things:
Serve html files!
Compile scss to css!
Create html projects!

#### Note:
if you use external sources from your directory (Like a script tag linking an external javascript file)
it won't work because htmanager does not serve the whole directory this should be fixed soon though.
